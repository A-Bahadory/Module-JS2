# ðŸ§­ Guide to Week 1 exercises

This README will guide you through the different sections for this week.

## Setup

Go to the **root of this repository**. Double check you're there with `pwd`. Also double check with `ls`.
**If you're in the root you should be able to see the `week-1`, `week-2` and `week-3` directories**

Run the command `npm install` in the root of this repo.

To run tests in the `week-1` directory you can:

1. Change directory into `week-1`
2. Run the tests using `npm test`

## Exercises

In this section, you'll have a short program and task. Some of the syntax may be unfamiliar - in this case, you'll need to look things up in documentation.

## Errors

In this section, you'll need to go to each file in `errors` directory and run the file with node to check what the error is. Your task is to interpret the error message and explain why it occurs. The [errors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors) will help you figure out the solution.

## Interpret

In these tasks, you have to interpret a slightly larger program with some syntax / operators / functions that may be unfamiliar.
You must use documentation to make sense of anything unfamiliar - learning how to look things up this way is a fundamental part of being a developer!
You can also use `console.log` to check the value of different variables in the code.

## Explore - Stretch ðŸ’ª

This stretch activity will get you to start exploring new concepts and environments by yourself. It will do so by prompting you to reflect on some questions.
